\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Often neural networks are seen as black boxes.
		\item We may want to figure out what they are doing internally.

\section{\scshape Filters}
\begin{frame}{Filters}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The most straightforward way to understand a ConvNet is by plotting its filters.
		\item We can easily extract the first

			{\smaller \texttt{python visualize\_weights.py}}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unsurprisingly, they extract very simple features from the images.
		\item Plotting the weights from the upper layers is possible, but becomes increasingly boring.
		\item We want a general way of visualizing the ConvNet.
	\end{itemize}

\section{\scshape Data Driven}
\begin{frame}{Data Driven}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The data driven approach consists in using lots of data to infer the network behavior.
		\item We can feed a large dataset to a model and keep track of the images that maximally activate some neuron.
		\item This gives us a sense of what the neuron is looking for.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Data Driven}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Additionally, we can slide an occlusion window through the input image and keep track of how the ground truth label score behaves.
		\item We then plot a heatmap and determine the network's region of interest.
